## Readme:
The present script is used for the visualization of statistical indicators related to the verification of climate data series derived through model predictions (ICON-LAM; COSMO). The main output represents a linear heatmap linked to the mean error (ME) and root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and predicted thresholds in certain lead time steps.

### Keywords: 
temperature, ICON, COSMO, HNMS
